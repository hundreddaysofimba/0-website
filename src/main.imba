		<h2> "Conditions"
		<p> "Each project:"
		<ul>
			<li> "{<b [tt:uppercase]> "must"} be developed on at least two consecutive days (recommended on weekends)."
			<li> "{<b [tt:uppercase]> "must"} be JAMStack (Javascript + API + Markup) using {<a href="https://imba.io" target="_blank"> "Imba"}."
			<li> "{<b [tt:uppercase]> "must"} have its own repository on Github, under the same organization."
			<li> "{<b [tt:uppercase]> "must"} have it's own URL under the root URL organization."
			<li> "{<b [tt:uppercase]> "can"} use LocalStorage as local database (if applicable)."
			<li> "{<b [tt:uppercase]> "can"} use any form of external or distributed storage (if applicable)."
			<li> "{<b [tt:uppercase]> "should"} be documented with a README.md file, explaining what they need for its operation and what was learned during the process."
		<h2> "Projects suggested"
		<div [d:grid gtc:4 gtc@!840:2 gtc@!420:1 gap:1rem]> for project in projects
			<project-item data=project @openDialog=toggle_modal>
		<h2> "Additional commitments"
		<ul>
			<li> "Each project completed should be shared, on social media, promoting both hashtags {<span> "#100DaysOfCode"} and {<span> "#100DaysOfImba"}, with a brief summary of what was learned."
			<li> "Each project should be ended within the time suggested. Consider how much hours do you need each day to reach the goal."
			<li> "All images in each project should be uploaded on SVG format (except favicons)."
			<li> "Each project can include any CSS Framework you consider, in order to speed your process, but {<a href="https://imba.io" target="_blank"> "Imba"} has it's own CSS engine, which is recommended ;)"
			<li> "All projects can be developed using Flat Design, Material Design, or whatever UI pattern design you want, but you must be consistent in which pattern design you choose. I mean, if the first project you completed (whatever it was) you made it on a Material Design, you should complete all remaining projects in that UI pattern design."
		<p> "Good luck and May the force be with you! ðŸ˜Œ"
